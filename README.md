Consider an initial date.  You invest $10,000 in SPX and $10,000 in UPRO.  Then the "sunlight" date is the date on which your investment in UPRO is thereafter never less valuable than your investment in SPX.  

(1) Unit testing has not been performed.
(2) Presently the analysis involves no rebalancing.  UPRO is susceptible to steepness in the price curve.
